\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In the United States (U.S.), major progress towards water quality goals
have been achieved through the Clean Water Act of 1972. This progress
has been largely attributed to investments and reductions in point
source discharges while reductions in nonpoint source pollutants remain
a substantial challenge
\citep{benhamLessonsLearnedTMDL2008, nationalresearchcouncilAssessingTMDLApproach2001, schrammTotalMaximumDaily2022}.
Increased pollutant loads and pollutant concentrations in runoff are a
particular challenge when dealing with nonpoint source pollution
resulting from land use change. The impacts of land use change on
hydrology and water quality are well established
\citep{allanLandscapesRiverscapesInfluence2004, carpenterNonpointPollutionSurface1998, bernhardtUnderstandingManagingMinimizing2008, careyEvaluatingNutrientImpacts2013, freemanImpactsUrbanizationDevelopment2019}.
Nonpoint source driven fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), nitrogen,
phosphorus, and suspended sediment remain major causes of water quality
impairments in U.S. rivers and streams despite decades of work. In 2017,
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated 41\% or more of the
nation's rivers and streams rated poorly for biological condition due to
excess nitrogen or phosphorus \citep{epaNationalWaterQuality2017}. FIB
remains the leading cause of water body impairment on the Clean Water
Act 303(d) list in the United States
\citep{epaNationalWaterQuality2017}.

Best management practices (BMPs) have been the primary suite of tools
for addressing nonpoint source pollution. BMPs are structural or
non-structural controls used to mitigate the effects of increased runoff
volume, pollutant loads, or pollutant concentrations emanating from
diffuse nonpoint sources. BMPs control the delivery of pollutants
through a few possible mechanisms. Structural BMPs reduce and retard
total volume of runoff, thus reducing both the volume of water and
pollutant load. Structural BMPs may also provide a mechanism for
physical, chemical, or biological removal of pollutant constituents
suspended or dissolved in runoff. Non-structural BMPs (such as nutrient
management or livestock management) are utilized to reduce the
generation of pollutant runoff by avoiding pollutant generation during
critical periods.

Practitioners rely extensively on mechanistic models to plan and
evaluate BMP scenarios and resulting water quality.
\citet{linternBestManagementPractices2020} found 43\% of reviewed BMP
effectiveness studies relied completely on modeled outputs, with modeled
outputs almost always predicting water quality improvements following
BMP implementation. However, field studies are much more likely to
demonstrate mixed results including net releases of pollutants under
certain conditions
\citep{linternBestManagementPractices2020, liuReviewEffectivenessBest2017}.
The disconnect between modeled outcomes and field studies might be
attributed to (1) overly simplified or incorrect estimates of parameters
that represent management practices
\citep{ullrichApplicationSoilWater2009, fuReviewCatchmentscaleWater2019, linternBestManagementPractices2020},
(2) failure to incorporate uncertainty in estimates
\citep{tasdighiBayesianTotalUncertainty2018, fuReviewCatchmentscaleWater2019, linternBestManagementPractices2020},
and (3) assumption of static performance over time
\citep{mealsLagTimeWater2010, liuReviewEffectivenessBest2017, fuReviewCatchmentscaleWater2019}.

A source of uncertainty comes from the substantial variability of
performance metrics reported in empirical BMP studies
\citep{linternBestManagementPractices2020}. Previous empirical reviews
generally describe high variability and uncertainty in nitrogen and
phosphorus removal and consistent reduction in total suspended sediment
concentrations across BMP types
\citep{linternBestManagementPractices2020, liuReviewEffectivenessBest2017, kochNitrogenRemovalStormwater2014, claryBMPPerformanceAnalysis2011, barrettComparisonBMPPerformance2008, grudzinskiDoesRiparianFencing2020}.
The review literature on the effects of BMPs on FIBs are sparse but
generally find extremely high variance in performance across BMPs
\citep{claryBMPPerformanceAnalysis2011, grudzinskiDoesRiparianFencing2020}.
Accurately characterizing BMP treated runoff quality is challenging due
to the high variability in BMP performance. However, influent water
quality, seasonality, and BMP age provide some explanatation to highliy
heterogenous BMP efficiency data
\citep{barrettPerformanceComparisonStructural2005, liuReviewEffectivenessBest2017}.\\
A recent meta-analysis demonstrated the further linkages between local
climatic conditions and BMP performance on nitrogen and phosphorus
concentrations \citep{horvathEffectsRegionalClimate2023}.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

We conducted a systematic review of recent (2000-2022) literature to
compile field studies documenting the effectiveness of best management
practices on fecal indicator bacteria and nutrients concentrations. The
systematic review followed guidance provided in the Collaboration for
Environmental Evidence systematic review guidelines
\citep{collaborationforenvironmentalevidenceGuidelinesStandardsEvidence2018}.
In order to maximize the number of studies included in the review, we
included both peer-reviewed studies and unpublished white papers to
reduce potential bias against negative results. The inclusion criteria
filtered out (1) non-field studies, (2) modelling results, (3) studies
that did not evaluate specific BMPs, (4) studies conducted outside of
the U.S. or published in a language other than English. We ran search
queries in Texas A\&M Library Catalog, Web of Science, and Google
Scholar. Although results from Google Scholar are not always replicable,
we utilized the service to maximize search results for studies not
published in academic journals and presumably increase the chance of
identifying studies with negative effects. Fecal indicator bacteria
study seraches included the following query: ``fecal indicator
bacteria'' OR ``E. coli'' OR ``Escherichia coli'' OR ``enterococci'' OR
``enterococcus'' AND ``best management practices'' OR ``BMPs'' AND
``effectiveness'' OR ``performance''. Nutrient BMP studies utilized a
similar query: ``nutrient'' OR ``nitrogen'' OR ``phosphorus'' OR
``sediment'' OR ``TSS'' AND ``best management practices'' OR ``BMPs''
AND ``effectiveness'' OR ``performance''.

Results from each database were first filtered to remove duplicates.
After removal of duplicates, each member of the research team (\emph{n}
= 4) was assigned a subset of studies to evaluate if they should be
included. \textbf{include supplementary tables with inclusion criteria
and data variables} Each study was reviewed by two team members and
differences in opinion were collectively discussed and agreed upon
before progressing. The remaining studies were split among team members
for data extraction, again with at least two team members reviewing each
study. If data was provided in figures, the data was extracted with the
WebPlotDigitizer tool \citep{rohatgiWebPlotDigitizer2022}.

\hypertarget{effect-size-calculation}{%
\subsection*{Effect size calculation}\label{effect-size-calculation}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Effect size calculation}

Prior BMP reviews routinely report the effect of BMPs using efficiency
values
\citep[see][]{agouridisLivestockGrazingManagement2005, krogerReviewBestManagement2012, liuEnhancingRainfallrunoffModel2015, simpsonDevelopingBestManagement2009}.
Efficiency values are calculated as:

\[
\text{Efficiency}=\frac{x_{control}-x_{experiment}}{x_{control}}\times 100,
\]

where \emph{x\textsubscript{control}} is the pre-treatment or control
pollutant concentration and \emph{x\textsubscript{experiment}} is the
pollutant concentration measured after the BMP intervention. There are
several statistical shortcomings (distributional asymetry, skewness, and
non-additive properties) when using efficiency to estimate overall
effect sizes
\citep{nuzzoPercentDifferencesAnother2018, coleStatisticsNotesWhat2017}.
In comparision, the log ratio of means (\emph{ROM}) provide preferable
statistical properties for regression analysis
\citep{osenbergEffectSizeEcological1997, hedgesMetaanalysisResponseRatios1999}.
\emph{ROM} quantifies the difference in means between the control and
experimental group \citep{hedgesMetaanalysisResponseRatios1999}:

\[
ROM_i = ln\left(\frac{x_{i,control}}{x_{i,experiment}}\right) = ln(x_{i, control})-ln(x_{i, experiment}),
\] where \emph{x\textsubscript{i,control}} and
\emph{x\textsubscript{i,experiment}} are the mean pollutant
concentrations for experiment \emph{i}. The statistical properties of
\emph{lnRR} (normal distribution around zero and additive properties)
are preferable to the more commonly reported efficiency metric
\citep{osenbergEffectSizeEcological1997, hedgesMetaanalysisResponseRatios1999}.
Use of \emph{ROM} required the exclusion of studies that only provided
measures of BMP efficiency and not the underlying data used to derive
the metric.

\hypertarget{statistical-models}{%
\subsection{Statistical models}\label{statistical-models}}

We used the ``rma.mv'' function in the \emph{metafor} R package to fit
multilevel random effects linear models with \emph{ROM} as the effect
variable
\citep{viechtbauerConductingMetaanalysesMetafor2010, rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2023}.
Our models specified a nested random effects term accounting for
heterogeneity between effect sizes from the same study and for
heterogeneity between studies. A key feature of meta-analysis is the
weighting of effects using sampling variance of individual effect sizes.
45\% of fecal indicator bacteria, 68\% of TN, 68\% of TP, and 70\% of
TSS effect sizes were missing standard deviations required to estimate
sampling variance. Removal of studies due to missing variance
information can introduce substantial bias
\citep{kambachConsequencesMultipleImputation2020}, so we imputed missing
standard deviations using random forest based multivariate imputation
with chained equations using the \emph{mice} R package
\citep{buurenMiceMultivariateImputation2011}. Sampling variance was
estimated with the variance estimator described in Doncaster et al.~to
reduce bias in small sample studies:

\[
v(ROM) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}{(CV^2_{control,i})/K}}{n_{control}} + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}{(CV^2_{experiment,i})/K}}{n_{experiment}},
\]

where \emph{v} represents the sampling variance, \(CV_{control,i}\) and
\(CV^2_{experiment,i}\) are the coefficients of variation from the
\emph{i}th study for studies 1, 2, \ldots, \emph{K}.

Our initial models included log transformed pre-treatment pollutant
concentration, study scale (plot/field, community, watershed), study
length (\emph{n} years), BMP subcategory (), and pollutant
concentration:BMP subcategory interactions were included as fixed effect
terms. We used an information-theoretic approach to select the most
parsimonious model from the subset of candidate models based on
corrected Akaike information criterion (AIC\textsubscript{c}) estimated
with maximum likelihood \citep{cinarUsingInformationTheoretic2021}. The
final model was selected from candidate models, which included all
combination and subsets of the full model, by eliminating candidate
models until the \(\Delta\)\emph{AIC\textsubscript{c}} reached \(\leq\)
2 \citep{burnhamAICModelSelection2011}. We estimated regression
coefficients of the selected model using restricted maximum likelihood.
Relative heterogeneity between and within studies were calculated using
the \emph{I\textsuperscript{2}} metric described in
\citet{nakagawaMethodologicalIssuesAdvances2012}. Marginal
\emph{R\textsuperscript{2}} was used to describe the amount of variance
explained by fixed effects \citep{nakagawaGeneralSimpleMethod2013}.

We tested for evidence of publication bias, in the form of small study
effect, by using the extension of Egger's regression applied to the
multilevel model framework that included adjusted sampling error as a
moderator \citep{nakagawaQuantitativeEvidenceSynthesis2023}. We did not
identify evidence of publication bias in the surveyed studies for fecal
indicator bacteria (\emph{Z} = -1.17, \emph{p} = 0.25), total nitrogen,
total phosphorus, or total suspended solids; therefore, adjustments for
publication bias were not included in the final models. We conducted a
sensitivity analysis of the robustness of overall effect sizes to
individual studies using leave-one-out analysis
\citep{nakagawaQuantitativeEvidenceSynthesis2023}. Outlier studies
identified in the sensitivity analysis are highlighted in Table X and
were removed prior to fitting the final models.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Linking BMP performance to watershed scale improvements remains a
challenge (Tomer and Locke, Melland et al, Meals). The succesful
implementation and maintence of BMPs at watershed scales remains an area
for more investigation (Liu et al., Lintern) Long-term
trans-disciplinary monitoring projects not just on BMP performance but
maintance, management, and social apsects may elucidate unknown factors
influencing the ability to scale BMP reductions to watershed scale
improvements (Lintern et al.)

Runoff volume was not incorporated into our models, largely attributed
to lack of available data. However, BMP size is typically scaled to
accommodate runoff volumes of a particular return period volume (1-yr or
2-yr flows for example) (Hoss et al.).
